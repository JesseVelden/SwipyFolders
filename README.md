# SwipyFolders
*The way folders on iOS meant to be*  

Sick of the ugly folders stairing at you? Ever wanted to swipe your folders open? Double tap actions? Short hold, or even 3D touch on a folder?  
**Now you can!** With **SwipyFolders** you can customize your folder experience.  

Basically two screenshots are worth two thousand words:  

Settings                                | Interface (first icon as folder preview)

Available actions:
* Single Tap
* Swipe Up
* Double Tap
* Short hold
* 3D Touch (aka Force Touch)

Every action can be customized to:  
* Open folder  
* Open first app  
* Open second app  
* Quick action on first icon (3D touch only)

You can even set the first icon as the folder preview. Bye bye ugly looking folders!
