Sick of the ugly folders staring at you? Ever wanted to swipe your folders open? Double tap actions? Short hold, or even 3D touch on a folder?  
**Now you can!** With **SwipyFolders** you can customize your folder experience.  

Basically two screenshots are worth two thousand words:  

Settings                                | Interface (first icon as folder preview)

Available gestures:
* Single Tap
* Swipe Up
* Swipe Down
* Double Tap
* Short hold
* 3D Touch (aka Force Touch)

Every gesture can be customized to:  
* Open folder  
* Open first app  
* Open second app  
* Quick action on first icon
* Open custom app with index
* Open last app in the folder
* Open the last opened app of the folder

You can even set the first icon as the folder preview, and removing the background from the folder icon. Bye bye ugly looking folders!
Since version 1.4.0 SwipyFolders ships with per folder customizable settings!
